# Recommendation-Systems
Problem Definition

Letâ€™s say we have 8 users, and they have rated 8 different albums on a scale of 1 to 5. Note that not all users have rated all albums. The aim of this project is to find the nearest neighbor recommendations for any given User X

Given Data:
songData3 = {"Angelica": {"Blues Traveler": 3.5, "Broken Bells": 2.0, "Norah Jones": 4.5, "Phoenix": 5.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 1.5, "The Strokes": 2.5, "Vampire Weekend": 2.0},
         "Bill":{"Blues Traveler": 2.0, "Broken Bells": 3.5, "Deadmau5": 4.0, "Phoenix": 2.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 3.5, "Vampire Weekend": 3.0},
         "Chan": {"Blues Traveler": 5.0, "Broken Bells": 1.0, "Deadmau5": 1.0, "Norah Jones": 3.0, "Phoenix": 5, "Slightly Stoopid": 1.0},
         "Dan": {"Blues Traveler": 3.0, "Broken Bells": 4.0, "Deadmau5": 4.5, "Phoenix": 3.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 4.5, "The Strokes": 4.0, "Vampire Weekend": 2.0},
         "Hailey": {"Broken Bells": 4.0, "Deadmau5": 1.0, "Norah Jones": 4.0, "The Strokes": 4.0, "Vampire Weekend": 1.0},
         "Jordyn":  {"Broken Bells": 4.5, "Deadmau5": 4.0, "Norah Jones": 5.0, "Phoenix": 5.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 4.5, "The Strokes": 4.0, "Vampire Weekend": 4.0},
         "Sam": {"Blues Traveler": 5.0, "Broken Bells": 2.0, "Norah Jones": 3.0, "Phoenix": 5.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 4.0, "The Strokes": 5.0},
         "Veronica": {"Blues Traveler": 3.0, "Norah Jones": 5.0, "Phoenix": 4.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 2.5, "The Strokes": 3.0}
        }

In the first part, I wrote the code for the pearson method using the computationally efficient form
In the second part, I wrote the code to find the Nearest neighbour (k=1) recommendations for a given userX, based on the Pearson Correlation similarity measure coded in Part 1
